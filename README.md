# Exploit Tracker


The **Exploit Tracker** is a script designed to automatically discover new exploits and save results to a file or integrate with your Discord server. It can also search for exploits related to specific CVEs of your choice. This script can be scheduled as a cron job to run at specified intervals, ensuring you always have the latest exploit information without needing to manually execute it again.


## Features

- Result in a JSON file
- Ability to hooking new exploits into discord
- Search for exploits of your desired CVE (saving to a file)
- Ability to set repeat interval time
- Ability to log the status of the script and hooking into Discord


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/hunThubSpace/Exploit-Tracker.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Exploit-Tracker
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run script

```bash
  python3 exploit_tracker.py
```

Enter script mode

| No. | Mode | Reuirements 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Finding recent exploits | Only CVE id
| 2 | Search for a certain cve's exploits | Select Crawling Options

Enter crawling options
| No. | Options | Reuirements 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Results saved into file (default) | No any requirements
| 2 | Only hooking into discord | Needs hook_url (exploits) and log_url (logs)
| 3 | Both, file and hook options | Needs hook_url (exploits) and log_url (logs)

## Caution (First time of running)
If you intend to run the script for the first time in crawling mode, where the file db.txt has not been created yet, the script will initialize its database without searching for new exploits. After that, during the repeat interval, the script will search for new exploits based on its database.
